    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI aims to simulate human cognitive abilities such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making. It involves the creation of intelligent machines that can perceive and interpret information from their environment, learn from experience, and adapt to new situations. Example: One example of AI is virtual personal assistants like Siri or Alexa. These assistants use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries. They can perform tasks such as setting reminders, answering questions, playing music, and controlling smart home devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms learn from patterns and examples in data and improve their performance over time through experience. Example: An example of machine learning is email spam filtering. ML algorithms can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) and learn to classify new emails based on the patterns they have discovered. As users mark emails as spam or not spam, the algorithm continuously updates its model to improve its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It involves the use of artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to learn and extract high-level representations from complex data. Deep Learning algorithms excel at automatically learning intricate patterns and features from large amounts of data. Example: Image recognition is a common application of deep learning. Deep neural networks can be trained on vast datasets of labeled images to recognize and classify objects or identify patterns within images. For instance, a deep learning model can be trained to classify images of cats and dogs by learning the distinguishing features of each animal."
